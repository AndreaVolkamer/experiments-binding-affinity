# KinoML notebooks

These repository contains detailed execution instructions for the notebooks used in our structure-informed machine learning experiments. We put special emphasis in reproducibility of results by carefully specifying every aspect of the running environment. Outputs are sync'ed to Weights & Biases. This repository should only contain the input code.
