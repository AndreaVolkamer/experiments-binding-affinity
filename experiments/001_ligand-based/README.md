# Ligand-based studies

Experiments where the details learned are mainly provided by ligand information. No kinase information is provided, so we train one model for each kinase.


## How to use

Create a subdirectory and include a __copy__ of `train-test-*-template.ipynb`. Each subdirectory should _only_ contain a single notebook. You can use as many subdirectory levels as you want.
